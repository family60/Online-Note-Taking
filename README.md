# Online-Note-Taking
Application that allows user to write and save notes that they make. It uses Express.js to save and get the note data from a JSON file.

## Guide
Users may view already existing notes they may have taken on the left hand side of the webpage. Clicking on any pre-existing note will
then load the title of the note in the center of the page and its body/content underneath it. Additionally the use can make new notes
and save them by clicking the plus and save icons on the top right hand side of the page respectively. If the user wishes to
go back to the home page, they can click the top left icon/logo. Notes can be deleted by clicking on the red trash bin next to said
note on the left hand side of the page.
